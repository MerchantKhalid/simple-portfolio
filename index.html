          There are currently 3.5 billion smartphone users in the world. Pretty
          much every one of those phones does something for its owner that they
          used to do for themselves. Before all the apps, algorithms, and
          websites we have today, we used our brains to do things like
          remembering and recalling (phone numbers, calendar events, and other
          facts).

            The primary advantage for you to develop a website is that you will
            have a central point of contact for your upcoming customers and
            Leland has correctly identified it in this quote. It is very crucial
            to have a good first impression for your customers, and a website
            does this task flawlessly.

            Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding
            bugs to an empty text file.Debugging is twice as hard as writing the
            code in the first place.Therfore, if you write the code as cleverly
            as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it
